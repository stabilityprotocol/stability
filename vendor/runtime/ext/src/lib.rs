//! Environmental-aware externalities for EVM tracing in Wasm runtime. This enables
//! capturing the - potentially large - trace output data in the host and keep
//! a low memory footprint in `--execution=wasm`.
//!
//! - The original trace Runtime Api call is wrapped `using` environmental (thread local).
//! - Arguments are scale-encoded known types in the host.
//! - Host functions will decode the input and emit an event `with` environmental.
